### why aren't you registered at x?
we live over 3,000 miles from L'Andana and We're hoping to fly home to our __nearly full, small,__ apartment after the wedding without anything new.

### why not just ship things to California?

We only receive packages if we know they're coming in advance.  If something arrives while we're out of town it costs us a daily fee until we return home.  

### What's your hashtag?

we plan to completely disconnect from technology during the ceremony & reception and request that you join us, so we're not using a hashtag

### Can i take pictures?

we're paying __two__ awesome photographers for that. all of their pictures will be available to everyone after the wedding. we want you to just join us for fun!

### what are the meal choices?

L'Andana is a Restaraunt and prepares a seasonal menu, we'll select a limited menu close to the date and the day of the wedding, you'll tell the waitstaff your selection and any dietary restrictions.
